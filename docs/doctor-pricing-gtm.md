# Doctor & clinic pricing — GTM packaging

**Updated:** 2026-07-23

## Package matrix (include / exclude)

Source of truth for marketing bullets: `src/lib/constants/package-features.ts`  
Enforcement: `src/lib/utils/feature-flags.ts` (`hasFeature`)  
Pricing UI reads `LICENSE_TIERS` which pulls marketing lists from package-features.

## Free gateway rules

**Worth signing up:** account, org, free license, profile editor, specialties, public listing after admin verification, completion checklist.

**Must upgrade for:** online bookings, Stripe Connect, video, messaging, email+SMS+WhatsApp ops, analytics, care plans, waitlist, **all AI features**.

## Upsell ladder

1. Free → Starter: accept paid bookings, video, AI  
2. Starter → Professional: multi-channel reminders, analytics, waitlist, CRM (still **1 doctor**)  
3. Professional → Clinic: **3–15** seats, multi-location, testing included, practice ops

## Self-service plan changes

| Direction | When features change | Refunds |
|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| **Upgrade** (free→paid, starter→pro, …) | Immediately after Checkout / subscription update | N/A |
| **Downgrade** (pro→starter, paid→free, …) | **End of current paid period** (monthly cycle or **annual term**) | **No pro-rata refunds** |

Until period end, the **current** paid tier stays fully active. After cancel-to-free, webhook restores Founding Free. Re-upgrade is self-service Checkout.

Actions: `schedulePlanChange`, `cancelScheduledPlanChange`, `upgradeLicenseTier`, `createLicenseCheckout`.

## Billing

- **Monthly:** list price per month, **no lock-in** (month-to-month).  
- **Annual:** 12-month term; charge `10 × monthly` once per year (2 months free). Display effective monthly in whole pounds. Downgrade/cancel at annual period end.  
- Stripe: `getOrCreateLicensePriceId(tier, config, "monthly" | "annual")`.  
- Optional env: `STRIPE_PRICE_*_ANNUAL`.  

## Implementation notes

- License checkout: env `STRIPE_PRICE_*` for monthly; annual prices created/searched with metadata `billing_period=annual`.  
- Testing addon: `STRIPE_PRICE_TESTING_ADDON` + metadata `has_testing_addon=1`.  
- Consistency tests: `package-features.test.ts`, `billing-period.test.ts`, `tier-lifecycle.test.ts`.
